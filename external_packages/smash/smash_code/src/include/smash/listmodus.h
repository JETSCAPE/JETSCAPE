 * \ingroup modus
 * ListModus: Provides a modus for running SMASH on an external particle list,
 * for example as an afterburner calculation.
 *
 * To use this modus, choose
    Modus:         List
 * \code
 * General:
 *      Modus: List
 * \endcode
 * in the configuration file.
 *
 * Options for ListModus go in the "Modi"â†’"List" section of the
 * configuration:
 *
 * \code
 * Modi:
 *      List:
 *              # options here
 * \endcode

 * For configuring see \ref input_modi_list_.
 *
 *
 * Since SMASH is searching for collisions in computational frame time 't',
 * all particles need to be at the same time. If this is not the case in
 * the list provided, the particles will be propagated backwards on
 * straight lines ("anti-freestreaming"). To avoid unphysical interactions
 * of these particles, the back-propagated particles receive a
 * formation_time and zero cross_section_scaling_factor. The cross-sections
 * are set to zero during the time, where the particle will just propagate
 * on a straight line again to appear at the formation_time into the system.

   * (ii) The mass matches the pole mass of `pdgcode` in SMASH. If it does not,
   *      then a warning is printed, the pole mass of the particle is set equal
   *      to the corresponding mass from SMASH particle table and it's energy
   *      is recomputed as \f$ E^2 = p^2 + m^2 \f$.
   * (iii) Any stable particle is on-shell, i.e. \f$ E^2 - p^2 = m^2 \f$. If it
   *       is not, then a warning is printed and the energy is set to
   *       \f$ E^2 = p^2 + m^2 \f$.
   * This very tolerant behaviour is justified by the practical usage of SMASH
   * as afterburner. Usually particles unknown to SMASH are rare resonances,
   * which do not play a large role. Mass mismatch is typically less than 1%
   * and comes from rounding and from SMASH enforcing isospin symmetry
   * (for example the mass of neutral pion is artificially forced to be the
   * same as charged pion). On-shellness violation typically comes from the
   * insufficient number of significant digits in the input file + rounding.
