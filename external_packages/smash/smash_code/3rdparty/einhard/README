Einhard is a simple logging API for small to medium sized C++ applications.

The focus is on simple use, both regarding programming on building of applications. To achieve this on the programming side the API uses the normal stream based output style of C++. To achieve this on the building side it limits its dependencies on to the C++ standard library and boost, unlike e.g. log4cxx which requires the Apache Portable Runtime.

For installation instructions please review the INSTALL file.

If you do your build configuration using CMake you can add the FindEinhard.cmake to your project to find a version of Einhard on your target system.
