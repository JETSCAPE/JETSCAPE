<h2>Four-Vectors</h2> 
 
The <code>Vec4</code> class gives a simple implementation of four-vectors. 
The member function names are based on the assumption that these 
represent four-momentum vectors. Thus one can get or set 
<ei>p_x, p_y, p_z</ei> and <ei>e</ei>, but not <ei>x, y, z</ei> 
or <ei>t</ei>. This is only a matter of naming, however; a 
<code>Vec4</code> can equally well be used to store a space-time 
four-vector. 
 
<p/> 
The <code>Particle</code> object contains a <code>Vec4 p</code> that 
stores the particle four-momentum, and another <code>Vec4 vProd</code> 
for the production vertex. For the latter the input/output method 
names are adapted to the space-time character rather than the normal 
energy-momentum one. Thus a user would not normally access the 
<code>Vec4</code> classes directly, but only via the methods of the 
<code>Particle</code> class, 
see <aloc href="ParticleProperties">Particle Properties</aloc>. 
 
<p/> 
Nevertheless you are free to use the PYTHIA four-vectors, e.g. as 
part of some simple analysis code based directly on the PYTHIA output, 
say to define the four-vector sum of a set of particles. But note that 
this class was never set up to allow complete generality, only  to 
provide the operations that are of use inside PYTHIA. There is no 
separate class for three-vectors, since such can easily be represented 
by four-vectors where the fourth component is not used. 
 
<p/> 
Four-vectors have the expected functionality: they can be created, 
copied, added, multiplied, rotated, boosted, and manipulated in other 
ways. Operator overloading is implemented where reasonable. Properties 
can be read out, not only the components themselves but also for derived 
quantities such as absolute momentum and direction angles. 
 
<h3>Constructors and basic operators</h3> 
 
A few methods are available to create or copy a four-vector: 
 
<method name="Vec4::Vec4(double x = 0., double y = 0., double z = 0., 
double t = 0.)"> 
creates a four-vector, by default with all components set to 0. 
</method> 
 
<method name="Vec4::Vec4(const Vec4& v)"> 
creates a four-vector copy of the input four-vector. 
</method> 
 
<method name="Vec4& Vec4::operator=(const Vec4& v)"> 
copies the input four-vector. 
</method> 
 
<method name="Vec4& Vec4::operator=(double value)"> 
gives a  four-vector with all components set to <ei>value</ei>. 
</method> 
 
<h3>Member methods for input</h3> 
 
The values stored in a four-vector can be modified in a few different 
ways: 
 
<method name="void Vec4::reset()"> 
sets all components to 0. 
</method> 
 
<method name="void Vec4::p(double pxIn, double pyIn, double pzIn, 
double eIn)"> 
sets all components to their input values. 
</method> 
 
<method name="void Vec4::p(Vec4 pIn)"> 
sets all components equal to those of the input four-vector. 
</method> 
 
<method name="void Vec4::px(double pxIn)"> 
</method> 
<methodmore name="void Vec4::py(double pyIn)"> 
</methodmore> 
<methodmore name="void Vec4::pz(double pzIn)"> 
</methodmore> 
<methodmore name="void Vec4::e(double eIn)"> 
sets the respective component to the input value.

<h3>Friend methods for output</h3> 
 
There are also some <code>friend</code> methods that take one, two 
or three four-vectors as argument. Several of them only use the 
three-vector part of the four-vector. 
 
<method name="friend ostream& operator&lt;&lt;(ostream&, const Vec4& v)"> 
writes out the values of the four components of a <code>Vec4</code> and, 
within brackets, a fifth component being the invariant length of the 
four-vector, as provided by <code>mCalc()</code> above, and it all 
ended with a newline. 
</method>

const Vec4& v3)"> 
the cross-product of three four-vectors: 
<ei>v_i = epsilon_{iabc} v1_a v2_b v3_c</ei>.

</methodmore> 
 
<method name="friend double phi(const Vec4& v1, const Vec4& v2,

</methodmore> 
 
<method name="friend bool pShift( Vec4& p1Move, Vec4& p2Move, 
double m1New, double m2New)"> 
transfer four-momentum between the two four-vectors so that they get 
the masses <code>m1New</code> and <code>m2New</code>, respectively. 
Note that <code>p1Move</code> and <code>p2Move</code> act both as 
input and output arguments. The method will return false if the invariant 
mass of the four-vectors is too small to accommodate the new masses, 
and then the four-vectors are not changed. 
</method> 
 
<method name="friend pair&lt;Vec4,Vec4&gt; getTwoPerpendicular(const Vec4& v1,

and more:

<method name="void Vec4::flip4()">

</method> 
 
<h3>Rotations and boosts</h3> 
 
A common task is to rotate or boost four-vectors. In case only one 
four-vector is affected the operation may be performed directly on it. 
However, in case many particles are affected, the helper class 
<code>RotBstMatrix</code> can be used to speed up operations. 
 
<method name="void Vec4::rot(double theta, double phi)"> 
rotate the three-momentum with the polar angle <ei>theta</ei> 
and the azimuthal angle <ei>phi</ei>. 
</method> 
 
<method name="void Vec4::rotaxis(double phi, double nx, double ny, 
double nz)"> 
rotate the three-momentum with the azimuthal angle <ei>phi</ei> 
around the direction defined by the <ei>(n_x, n_y, n_z)</ei> 
three-vector. 
</method> 
 
<method name="void Vec4::rotaxis(double phi, Vec4& n)"> 
rotate the three-momentum with the azimuthal angle <ei>phi</ei> 
around the direction defined by the three-vector part of <ei>n</ei>. 
</method> 
 
<method name="void Vec4::bst(double betaX, double betaY, double betaZ)"> 
boost the four-momentum by <ei>beta = (beta_x, beta_y, beta_z)</ei>. 
</method> 
 
<method name="void Vec4::bst(double betaX, double betaY, double betaZ, 
double gamma)"> 
boost the four-momentum by <ei>beta = (beta_x, beta_y, beta_z)</ei>, 
where the <ei>gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2)</ei> is also input to allow 
better precision when <ei>beta</ei> is close to unity. 
</method> 
 
<method name="void Vec4::bst(const Vec4& p)"> 
boost the four-momentum by <ei>beta = (p_x/E, p_y/E, p_z/E)</ei>. 
</method> 
 
<method name="void Vec4::bst(const Vec4& p, double m)"> 
boost the four-momentum by <ei>beta = (p_x/E, p_y/E, p_z/E)</ei>, 
where the <ei>gamma = E/m</ei> is also calculated from input to allow 
better precision when <ei>beta</ei> is close to unity. 
</method> 
 
<method name="void Vec4::bstback(const Vec4& p)"> 
boost the four-momentum by <ei>beta = (-p_x/E, -p_y/E, -p_z/E)</ei>. 
</method> 
 
<method name="void Vec4::bstback(const Vec4& p, double m)"> 
boost the four-momentum by <ei>beta = (-p_x/E, -p_y/E, -p_z/E)</ei>, 
where the <ei>gamma = E/m</ei> is also calculated from input to allow 
better precision when <ei>beta</ei> is close to unity. 
</method> 
 
<method name="void Vec4::rotbst(const RotBstMatrix& M)"> 
perform a combined rotation and boost; see below for a description 
of the <code>RotBstMatrix</code>. 
</method> 
 
<p/> 
For a longer sequence of rotations and boosts, and where several 
<code>Vec4</code> are to be rotated and boosted in the same way, 
a more efficient approach is to define a <code>RotBstMatrix</code>, 
which forms a separate auxiliary class. You can build up this 
4-by-4 matrix by successive calls to the methods of the class, 
such that the matrix encodes the full sequence of operations. 
The order in which you do these calls must agree with the imagined 
order in which the rotations/boosts should be applied to a 
four-momentum, since in general the operations do not commute. 
<br/>(Mathematically you would e.g. define <ei>M = M_3 M_2 M_1</ei> 
in that <ei>M p = M_3( M_2( M_1 p) ) )</ei>. That is, operations 
on the four-vector <ei>p</ei> are carried out in the order first 
<ei>M_1</ei>, then <ei>M_2</ei> and finally <ei>M_3</ei>. Thus 
<ei>M_1, M_2, M_3</ei> is also the order in which you should input 
rotations and boosts to <ei>M</ei>.) 
 
<method name="RotBstMatrix::RotBstMatrix()">

<ei>theta</ei> and <ei>phi</ei>, with angles defined by <ei>p</ei>. 
</method>

<method name="void RotBstMatrix::bst(const Vec4& p1, const Vec4& p2)"> 
boost so that <ei>p_1</ei> is transformed to <ei>p_2</ei>. It is assumed 
that the two vectors obey <ei>p_1^2 = p_2^2</ei>. 
</method>

<method name="void RotBstMatrix::fromCMframe(const Vec4& p1, const Vec4& p2)"> 
rotate and boost from the rest frame of <ei>p_1</ei> and <ei>p_2</ei>, 
with <ei>p_1</ei> along the <ei>+z</ei> axis, to the actual frame of 
<ei>p_1</ei> and <ei>p_2</ei>, i.e. the inverse of the above. 
</method> 
 
<method name="void RotBstMatrix::rotbst(const RotBstMatrix& Min);"> 
combine the current matrix with another one. 
</method> 
 
<method name="void RotBstMatrix::invert()"> 
invert the matrix, which corresponds to an opposite sequence and sign 
of rotations and boosts. 
</method>
