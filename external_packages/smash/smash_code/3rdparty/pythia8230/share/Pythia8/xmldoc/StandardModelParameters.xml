<h2>Standard-Model Parameters</h2> 
 
<h3>The strong coupling</h3> 
 
The <code>AlphaStrong</code> class is used to provide a first- or 
second-order running <ei>alpha_strong</ei> (or, trivially, a 
zeroth-order fixed one). Formulae are the standard ones found in 
<ref>Yao06</ref>. The second-order expression used, eq. (9.5), 
may be somewhat different in other approaches (with differences 
formally of higher order), so do not necessarily expect perfect 
agreement, especially not at small <ei>Q^2</ei> scales. The starting 
<ei>alpha_strong</ei> value is defined at the <ei>M_Z</ei> mass scale. 
The <ei>Lambda</ei> values are matched at the <ei>c</ei>, <ei>b</ei> 
and <ei>t</ei> flavour thresholds, 
such that <ei>alpha_strong</ei> is continuous. 
For second-order matching an approximate iterative method is used. 
 
<p/> 
For backwards compatibility, 
the following global switch determines whether 5- or 6-flavour running 
will be used above the <ei>t</ei> threshold: 
<modepick name="StandardModel:alphaSnfmax" default="6" min="5" max="6"> 
<option value="5">Use 5-flavour running for all scales above the 
<ei>b</ei> flavour threshold (old default).</option> 
<option value="6">Use 6-flavour running above the <ei>t</ei> threshold 
(new default).</option> 
</modepick> 
 
<p/> 
Since we allow <ei>alpha_strong</ei> to vary separately for 
hard processes, timelike showers, spacelike showers and  multiparton 
interactions, all other relevant values are set in each of these classes. 
The default behaviour is everywhere first-order running. 
 
<p/> 
The <ei>alpha_strong</ei> calculation is initialized by 
<code>init( value, order, nfmax)</code>, where <code>value</code> 
is the <ei>alpha_strong</ei> value at <ei>M_Z</ei>, <code>order</code> 
is the order of the running, 0, 1 or 2, and <code>nfmax</code> 
is the highest number of flavours to include in the running. Thereafter 
the value can be calculated by <code>alphaS(scale2)</code>, where 
<code>scale2</code> is the <ei>Q^2</ei> scale in GeV^2. 
 
<p/> 
By default the charm, bottom and top threshold-matching mass values 
are chosen to be 1.5, 4.8 and 171 GeV, respectively. The 
<code>setThresholds(double mc, double mb, double mt)</code> 
method can be invoked to select other values. To take effect, this 
must be done before the <code>AlphaStrong::init()</code> method is called, 
since this is where the flavour-dependent <ei>Lambda_i</ei> values are 
calculated and stored. If in doubt, better call it once again. 
 
<p/> 
For applications inside shower programs, a second-order <code>alpha_s</code> 
value can be obtained as the product of the two functions 
<code>alphaS1Ord(scale2)</code> and <code>alphaS2OrdCorr(scale2)</code>, 
where the first gives a simple first-order running (but with the 
second-order <ei>Lambda</ei>) and the second the correction factor, 
below unity, for the second-order terms. This allows a compact handling 
of evolution equations. 
 
<p/> 
Resummation arguments <ref>Cat91</ref> show that a set of 
universal QCD corrections can be absorbed in coherent parton showers by 
applying the so-called CMW rescaling of the MSbar value of 
<ei>Lambda_QCD</ei>. This can be accomplished via a fourth (optional) 
boolean argument to <code>init( value, order, nfmax, useCMW)</code>, 
with default value <code>useCMW = false</code>. When set to 
<code>true</code>, the translation amounts to an <ei>N_F</ei>-dependent 
rescaling of <ei>Lambda_QCD</ei>, relative to its MSbar value, by 
a factor 1.661 for NF=3, 1.618 for NF=4, 1.569 for NF=5, 
and 1.513 for NF=6. When using this option, 
be aware that the original CMW arguments were derived using two-loop running 
and that the CMW rescaling may need be taken into account in the context of 
matrix-element matching. Note also that this option has only been made 
available for timelike and spacelike showers, not for hard processes. 
 
<h3>The electromagnetic coupling</h3> 
 
The <code>AlphaEM</code> class is used to generate a running 
<ei>alpha_em</ei>. The input <code>StandardModel:alphaEMmZ</code> 
value at the <ei>M_Z</ei> mass is matched to a low-energy behaviour 
with running starting at the electron mass threshold. The matching 
is done by fitting an effective running coefficient in the region 
between the light-quark threshold and the charm/tau threshold. This 
procedure is approximate, but good enough for our purposes. 
 
<p/> 
Since we allow <ei>alpha_em</ei> to vary separately for 
hard processes, timelike showers, spacelike showers and  multiparton 
interactions, the choice between using a fixed or a running 
<ei>alpha_em</ei> can be made in each of these classes. 
The default behaviour is everywhere first-order running. 
The actual values assumed at zero momentum transfer and 
at <ei>M_Z</ei> are only set here, however. 
 
<parm name="StandardModel:alphaEM0" default="0.00729735" 
min="0.0072973" max="0.0072974"> 
The <ei>alpha_em</ei> value at vanishing momentum transfer 
(and also below <ei>m_e</ei>). 
</parm> 
 
<parm name="StandardModel:alphaEMmZ" default="0.00781751" 
min="0.00780" max="0.00783"> 
The <ei>alpha_em</ei> value at the <ei>M_Z</ei> mass scale. 
Default is taken from <ref>Yao06</ref>. 
</parm> 
 
<p/> 
The <ei>alpha_em</ei> calculation is initialized by 
<code>init(order)</code>, where <code>order</code> is the order of 
the running, 0 or 1, with -1 a special option to use the fix value 
provided at <ei>M_Z</ei>.   Thereafter the value can be 
calculated by <code>alphaEM(scale2)</code>, where 
<code>scale2</code> is the <ei>Q^2</ei> scale in GeV^2. 
 
<h3>The electroweak couplings</h3> 
 
There are two degrees of freedom that can be set, related to the 
electroweak mixing angle: 
 
<parm name="StandardModel:sin2thetaW" default="0.2312" 
min="0.225" max="0.240"> 
The sine-squared of the weak mixing angle, as used in all <ei>Z^0</ei> 
and <ei>W^+-</ei> masses and couplings, except for the vector couplings 
of fermions to the <ei>Z^0</ei>, see below. Default is the MSbar value 
from <ref>Yao06</ref>. 
</parm> 
 
<parm name="StandardModel:sin2thetaWbar" default="0.2315" 
min="0.225" max="0.240"> 
The sine-squared of the weak mixing angle, as used to derive the vector 
couplings of fermions to the <ei>Z^0</ei>, in the relation 
<ei>v_f = a_f - 4 e_f sin^2(theta_W)bar</ei>. Default is the 
effective-angle value from <ref>Yao06</ref>. 
</parm> 
 
<p/> 
The Fermi constant is not much used in the currently coded matrix elements, 
since it is redundant, but it is available: 
 
<parm name="StandardModel:GF" default="1.16637e-5" 
min="1.0e-5" max="1.3e-5"> 
The Fermi coupling constant, in units of GeV<ei>^-2</ei>. 
</parm> 
 
<h3>The quark weak-mixing matrix</h3> 
 
The absolute values of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements are 
set by the following nine real values taken from <ref>Yao06</ref> - 
currently the CP-violating phase is not taken into account in this 
parametrization. It is up to the user to pick a consistent unitary 
set of new values whenever changes are made. 
 
<parm name="StandardModel:Vud" default="0.97383" min="0.973" max="0.975"> 
The <ei>V_ud</ei> CKM matrix element. 
</parm>

<h3>The CoupSM class</h3> 
 
The <code><aloc href="ProgramFlow">Pythia</aloc></code> class contains a 
public instance <code>coupSM</code> of the <code>CoupSM</code> class. 
This class contains one instance each of the <code>AlphaStrong</code> 
and <code>AlphaEM</code> classes, and additionally stores the weak couplings 
and the quark mixing matrix mentioned above. This class is used especially 
in the calculation of cross sections and resonance widths, but could also 
be used elsewhere. Specifically, as already mentioned, there are separate 
<code>AlphaStrong</code> and <code>AlphaEM</code> instances for timelike 
and spacelike showers and for multiparton interactions, while weak couplings 
and the quark mixing matrix are only stored here. With the exception of the 
first two methods below, which are for internal use, the subsequent ones 
could also be used externally.
