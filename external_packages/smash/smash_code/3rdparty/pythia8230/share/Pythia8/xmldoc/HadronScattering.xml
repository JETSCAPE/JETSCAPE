<h2>Hadron Scattering</h2> 
 
This page describes a few simple hadron (re)scattering models. 
They are intended to take into account 
that the overlap of multiple strings at low transverse dimensions 
is likely to lead to some collective effects, not unlike those 
observed in heavy-ion collisions, even if not quite as pronounced. 
Specifically, it is assumed that the hadrons produced can scatter 
against each other on the way out, before the fragmenting system 
has had time to expand enough that the hadrons get free. Thereby 
heavier particles are shifted to higher transverse momenta, at the 
expense of the lighter ones. 
 
<p/> 
The main switch on/off switch for rescattering is 
<code>HadronLevel:HadronScatter</code>, which by the default is off, 
since all models are rather simplistic and have to be used 
with some caution. Currently there are three different options available: 
 
<modepick name="HadronScatter:mode" default="0" 
min="0" max="2"> 
The first two options are variations of the same model, whereas 
option 2 respresents a different model. 
<option value="0"> The new model, based on separation in rapidity 
as described in <ref>Fis16</ref>. 
Further options are found <a href="#HadScatNew1">here</a>. 
</option> 
<option value="1"> The new model, based on separation in rapidity 
and azimuthal angle as described in <ref>Fis16</ref>. Further options 
are found  <a href="#HadScatNew2">here</a>. 
</option> 
<option value="2"> The old model. Further options are found 
<a href="#HadScatOld">here</a>. 
<note>Warning:</note> Option 2 is still at an experimental level, 
and should not be used unless you know what you are doing. 
</option>

<h3>The New Model for Hadron Scattering</h3> 
 
Within the new modle, there are two options available for how hadron 
pairs are found: 
 
<a name="HadScatNew1"></a> 
<h4>Rapidity based</h4> 
This corresponds to <code>HadronScatter:mode = 0</code>. 
<p/> 
Probe all hadron pairs with an invariant mass <ei> m<sub>inv</sub> &lt; 
(m<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>+p<sup>2</sup><sub>Max</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup> + 
(m<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub>+p<sup>2</sup><sub>Max</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup></ei> 
with the parameter <ei>p<sub>Max</sub></ei> 
<parm name="HadronScatter:pMax" default="0.5" min="0.1" max="1000000.0"> 
</parm> 
<br/> 
If a hadron pair passes this cut, the scattering probability for hadrons of 
different strings is <ei>P<sub>DS</sub>(&#x394y) = 
P<sup>max</sup><sub>DS</sub>(1 - &#x394y/&#x394y<sup>max</sup>)</ei> 
with rapidity difference <ei>&#x394y</ei> of the hadron pair and the 
parameters <ei>&#x394y<sup>max</sup></ei> 
<parm name="HadronScatter:yDiffMax" default="1.0" min="0.1" max="10.0"> 
</parm> 
<br/> 
and <ei>P<sup>max</sup><sub>DS</sub></ei>, see 
<a href="#HadScatNewCom">below</a>. If the hadrons are produced 
within the same string the probability is <ei>P<sub>DS</sub>(&#x394y) 
P<sup>max</sup><sub>SS</sub></ei> if the hadrons are further apart from each 
other as <code>HadronScatter:neighbourFar</code>, <ei>0</ei> if they are 
closer together as <code>HadronScatter:neighbourNear</code>, and linear 
between the maximum <code>HadronScatter:maxProbSS</code> and minimum 
probability <code>HadronScatter:minProbSS</code> inbetween. 
 
<a name="HadScatNew2"></a> 
<h4>Rapidity and Azimuth based</h4> 
This corresponds to <code>HadronScatter:mode = 1</code>. 
<p/> 
All hadron pairs are considered. The scattering probability for hadrons 
of different strings is <ei>P<sub>DS</sub>(&#x394y,&#x394&#x3C6) = 
P<sup>max</sup><sub>DS</sub>(1 - ((&#x394y)<sup>2</sup> 
+(&#x394&#x3C6)<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>/R<sup>max</sup>)</ei> 
with rapidity difference <ei>&#x394y</ei> and difference in azimuth 
<ei>&#x394&#x3C6</ei> of the hadron pair and the 
parameters <ei>R<sup>max</sup></ei> 
<parm name="HadronScatter:Rmax" default="1.0" min="0.1" max="10.0"> 
</parm> 
<br/> 
and <ei>P<sup>max</sup><sub>DS</sub></ei>, see 
<a href="#HadScatNewCom">below</a>. 
The probability for hadron pairs from the same string is similar 
to the one before. 
 
<a name="HadScatNewCom"></a> 
<h4>Common Parameters</h4> 
 
The following paramters are used for both the above cases: 
<flag name="HadronScatter:scatterSameString" default="on"> 
  If switched on, strings within the same string are allowed to 
  scatter off each other. Otherwise only hadron pairs that are 
  not produced on the same string are taken into account. 
</flag> 
 
<flag name="HadronScatter:scatterMultipleTimes" default="on"> 
  If switched off, each hadron is only allowed to scatter at most once. 
  By the way that possible scattering pairs are considered in order of 
  increasing rapidity separation, this introduces a bias towards pairs 
  with small <ei>y</ei> separation. 
</flag> 
 
<parm name="HadronScatter:maxProbDS" default="0.5" min="0.0" max="1.0"> 
  The maximum probability <ei>P<sup>max</sup><sub>DS</sub></ei> for the 
  scattering of two hadrons that are not part of the same string. 
</parm> 
 
<mode name="HadronScatter:neighbourNear" default="2" min="1" max="10"> 
  If scattering of hadrons within the same string is allowed this 
  parameter gives the closest neighbour that is allowed. The value 1 
  corresponds to the direct neighbour. The probability associated 
  with this potential scattering partner is <code>minProbSS</code>. 
</mode> 
 
<mode name="HadronScatter:neighbourFar" default="4" min="2" max="15"> 
  If scattering of hadrons within the same string is allowed this 
  parameter gives the neighbour starting from which the maximum 
  probability <code>maxProbSS</code> is applied. 
</mode> 
 
<parm name="HadronScatter:minProbSS" default="0.5" min="0.0" max="1.0"> 
  The minimum probability <ei>P<sup>min</sup><sub>SS</sub></ei> for the 
  scattering of two hadrons within the same string. (Relative to that for 
  different strings, i.e. for the total probability the baseline 
  <code>maxProbDS</code> factor also enters.) 
</parm> 
 
<parm name="HadronScatter:maxProbSS" default="1.0" min="0.0" max="1.0"> 
  The maximum probability <ei>P<sup>max</sup><sub>SS</sub></ei> for the 
  scattering of two hadrons within the same string. (Relative to that for 
  different strings, i.e. for the total probability the baseline 
  <code>maxProbDS</code> factor also enters.) 
</parm>

<h3>The Old Model for Hadron Scattering</h3> 
 
<note>Warning:</note> This is still at an experimental level, 
and should not be used unless you know what you are doing. 
 
<flag name="HadronScatter:afterDecay" default="off"> 
Perform hadron scattering before or after first round of decays, 
involving very short-lived particles like the <ei>rho</ei>. 
The default is to perform scattering directly after the 
string fragmentation, before any decays. 
</flag> 
 
<flag name="HadronScatter:allowDecayProd" default="off"> 
Allow two hadrons with same parent hadron to scatter. 
</flag> 
 
<flag name="HadronScatter:scatterRepeat" default="off"> 
Allow hadrons which have already scattered to scatter again. 
Even if switched on, the same pair can not scatter off each 
other twice. 
</flag> 
 
<h4>Hadron selection</h4> 
 
<modepick name="HadronScatter:hadronSelect" default="0" 
min="0" max="0"> 
Probability that a hadron is soft enough to scatter. 
(A high-<ei>pT</ei> hadron presumably being part of a jet, 
and thus produced away from the high-particle-density region 
at small transverse dimensions.) 
<option value="0"> 
<ei>P = N exp(-pT^2 / 2 / sigma^2) / 
  ( (1 - k) exp(-pT^2 / 2 / sigma^2) + k pT0^p / (pT0^2 + pT^2)^(p/2), </ei> 
with <ei>sigma = 2 StringPT:sigma</ei> and <ei>pT0</ei> the same as that 
used in <ei>MultipartonInteractions</ei>. 
</option> 
</modepick> 
 
<parm name="HadronScatter:N" default="1.0" min="0.01" max="1.0"> 
<ei>N</ei> parameter as above. 
</parm> 
<parm name="HadronScatter:k" default="1.0" min="0.01" max="1.0"> 
<ei>k</ei> parameter as above. 
</parm> 
<parm name="HadronScatter:p" default="6" min="2" max="30"> 
<ei>p</ei> parameter as above. 
</parm> 
 
<h4>Scattering probability</h4> 
 
<modepick name="HadronScatter:scatterProb" default="0" 
min="0" max="2"> 
Probability for a pair of hadrons to scatter. 
<option value="0">All hadrons scatter with probability 
<ei>j max(0, 1 - dR^2 / rMax^2)</ei>. Angular distribution 
is picked flat in <ei>cos(theta).</ei></option> 
<option value="1">As option 0, above, but only <ei>pi-pi</ei>, 
<ei>pi-K</ei> and <ei>pi-p</ei> scatterings are considered. 
</option> 
<option value="2">Only <ei>pi-pi</ei>, <ei>pi-K</ei> and 
<ei>pi-p</ei> scatterings are considered, with probability 
given by <ei>(1 - exp(-j sigEl)) max(0, 1 - dR^2 / rMax^2)</ei>. 
The elastic cross sections and angular distributions are taken 
from the partial-wave distributions. 
</option> 
</modepick> 
 
<parm name="HadronScatter:j" default="0.5" min="0.0" max="10.0"> 
<ei>j</ei> parameter as above. 
</parm> 
<parm name="HadronScatter:rMax" default="1.0" min="0.1" max="2.0"> 
<ei>rMax</ei> parameter as above. 
</parm> 
 
<flag name="HadronScatter:tile" default="off"> 
Use tiling in <ei>(eta, phi)</ei> to reduce number of pairwise tests. 
</flag>
