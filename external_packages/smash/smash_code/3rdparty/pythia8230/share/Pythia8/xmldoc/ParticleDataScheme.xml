<h2>The Particle Data Scheme</h2> 
 
The particle data scheme may take somewhat longer to understand than 
the settings one. In particular the set of methods to access information 
is rather more varied, to allow better functionality for advanced usage. 
However, PYTHIA does come with a sensible default set of particle 
properties and decay tables. Thus there is no need to learn any of the 
methods on this page to get going. Only when you perceive a specific need 
does it make sense to learn the basics. 
 
<p/> 
The central section on this page is the Operation one. The preceding 
sections are there mainly to introduce the basic structure and the set 
of properties that can be accessed. The subsequent sections provide a 
complete listing of the existing public methods, which most users 
probably will have little interaction with. 
 
<h3>Databases</h3> 
 
The management of particle data is based on three classes: 
<ul> 
<li><code>ParticleData</code>, which is the top-level class, with 
methods that can be used to interrogate all particle data. It contains 
a map of PDG particle identity numbers <ref>Yao06</ref> onto the relevant 
<code>ParticleDataEntry</code> objects,</li> 
<li><code>ParticleDataEntry</code>, which stores the relevant information 
on an individual particle species, and</li> 
<li><code>DecayChannel</code>, which stores info on one particular decay 
mode of a particle.</li> 
 
</ul> 
The objects of these classes together form a database that is 
continuously being used as the program has to assign particle masses, 
select decay modes, etc. 
 
<p/> 
Each <code>Pythia</code> object has a public member 
<code>particleData</code> of the <code>ParticleData</code> class. 
Therefore you access the particle data methods as 
<code>pythia.particleData.command(argument)</code>, 
assuming that <code>pythia</code> is an instance of the 
<code>Pythia</code> class. Further, for some of the most frequent user 
tasks, <code>Pythia</code> methods have been defined, so that 
<code>pythia.command(argument)</code> 
would work, see further below. 
 
<p/> 
A fundamental difference between the particle data classes and the 
settings ones is that the former are accessed regularly during the 
event generation process, as a new particle is produced and its mass 
need to be set, e.g., while the latter are mainly/only used 
at the initialization stage. Nevertheless, it is not a good idea to 
change data in either of them in mid-run, since this may lead to 
inconsistencies. 
 
<h3>Stored properties for particles</h3> 
 
The main properties stored for each particle are as follows. 
Different ways to set and get these properties will be described 
further down. 
 
<ul> 
 
<li><code>name</code>: a character string with the name of the 
particle. Particle and antiparticle names are stored separately, 
with <code>void</code> returned when no antiparticle exists.</li> 
 
<li><code>spinType</code>: the spin type, of the form <ei>2 s + 1</ei>, 
with special code 0 for entries of unknown or indeterminate spin.</li> 
 
<li><code>chargeType</code>: three times the charge (to make it an 
integer).</li> 
 
<li><code>colType</code>: the colour type, with 0 uncoloured, 1 triplet, 
-1 antitriplet and 2 octet. (A preliminary implementation of colour 
  sextets, available since version 8.150, further uses 3 for a sextet 
  and -3 for an antisextet.) </li> 
 
<li><code>m0</code>: the nominal mass <ei>m_0</ei> (in GeV).</li> 
 
<li><code>mWidth</code>: the width <ei>Gamma</ei> of the Breit-Wigner 
distribution (in GeV).</li> 
 
<li><code>mMin</code>: the lower limit of the allowed mass range 
generated by the Breit-Wigner (in GeV). Has no meaning for particles 
without width, and would typically be 0 there.</li> 
 
<li><code>mMax</code>: the upper limit of the allowed mass range 
generated by the Breit-Wigner (in GeV). If <ei>mMax &lt; mMin</ei> then 
no upper limit is imposed. Has no meaning for particles without width, 
and would typically be 0 there.</li> 
 
<li><code>tau0</code>: the nominal proper lifetime <ei>tau_0</ei> 
(in mm/c).</li> 
 
<li><code>isResonance</code>: a flag telling whether a particle species 
is considered as a resonance or not. Here 
<aloc href="ResonanceDecays">"resonance"</aloc> is used as shorthand 
for any massive particle where the decay process should be counted as part 
of the hard process itself, and thus be performed before showers and other 
event aspects are added. Restrictions on allowed decay channels is also 
directly reflected in the cross section of simulated processes, while 
those of normal hadrons and other light particles are not. 
In practice, it is reserved for states above the <ei>b bbar</ei> 
bound systems in mass, i.e. for <ei>W, Z, t</ei>, Higgs states, 
supersymmetric states and (most?) other states in any new theory. 
All particles with <code>m0</code> above 20 GeV are by default 
initialized to be considered as resonances.</li> 
 
<li><code>mayDecay</code>: a flag telling whether a particle species 
may decay or not, offering the main user switch. Whether a given particle 
of this kind then actually will decay also depends on it having allowed 
decay channels, and on other flags for 
<aloc href="ParticleDecays">particle decays</aloc> 
(or <aloc href="ResonanceDecays">resonance decays</aloc>). 
All particles with <code>tau0</code> below 1000 mm are 
by default initialized to allow decays.</li> 
 
<li><code>doExternalDecays</code>: a flag telling whether a particle 
should be handled by an external decay package or not, with the latter 
default. Can be manipulated as described on this page, but should 
normally not be. Instead the 
<code><aloc href="ExternalDecays">Pythia::decayPtr(...)</aloc></code> 
method should be provided with the list of relevant particles.</li> 
 
<li><code>isVisible</code>: a flag telling whether a particle species 
is to be considered as visible in a detector or not, as used e.g. in 
analysis routines. By default the invisibles include neutrinos, 
Dark Matter particles (codes 51 - 60) and a few BSM particles (gravitino, 
sneutrinos, neutralinos) that have neither strong nor electromagnetic 
charge, and are not made up of constituents that have it. The value of 
this flag is only relevant if a particle is long-lived enough actually 
to make it to a detector.</li> 
 
<li><code>doForceWidth</code>: a flag applicable only for resonances 
(see <code>isResonance</code> above), whereby it is possible to force 
resonances to retain their assigned width, whatever that is, see 
<aloc href="ResonanceDecays">Resonance Decays</aloc> for details.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<h3>Stored properties for decays</h3> 
 
An unstable particle has a decay table consisting of one or more 
decay channel. The following properties are stored for each such channel. 
Again different ways to set and get these properties will be described 
further down. 
<ul> 
 
<li><code>onMode</code>: integer code for use or not of channel,<br/> 
0 if a channel is off,<br/> 
1 if on,<br/> 
2 if on for a particle but off for an antiparticle,<br/> 
3 if on for an antiparticle but off for a particle.<br/> 
If a particle is its own antiparticle then 2 is on and 3 off 
but, of course, for such particles it is much simpler and safer 
to use only 1 and 0.<br/> 
The 2 and 3 options can be used e.g. to encode CP violation in 
B decays, or to let the <ei>W</ei>'s in a <ei>q qbar &rarr; W^+ W^-</ei> 
process decay in different channels. </li> 
 
<li><code>bRatio</code>: the branching ratio of the channel 
(with some reservations for resonances, see <code>meMode</code> 
below).</li> 
 
<li><code>meMode</code>: the mode of processing this channel, possibly 
with matrix elements; see the 
<aloc href="ParticleDecays">particle decays</aloc> and 
<aloc href="ResonanceDecays">resonance decays</aloc> 
descriptions for the list of possibilities. 
Notably the default code 0 for a particle means pure phase space 
decays according to the given branching ratios, while for a resonance 
it means that code exists for the dynamic calculations of partial 
widths and thereby branching ratios as a function of the resonance mass 
(which is done e.g. at initialization based on the mass set by the user). 
Then codes 1 - 99 are reserved for various matrix-element-improved 
ordinary particle decays, and 100 - 103 for resonances where the 
partial width of a given channel is calculated from the total width 
and the stored branching ratio. Thus, to enforce a new branching ratio 
for a resonance channel (with its own partial-width calculation code) 
it is not sufficient only to change the <code>bRatio</code> but also 
to set e.g. <code>meMode = 100</code>. </li> 
 
<li><code>multiplicity</code>: the number of decay products of the 
channel. Can be at most 8.</li> 
 
<li><code>product(i)</code>: the identity code of the decay products, 
where <code>i</code> runs between <code>0</code> and 
<code>multiplicity - 1</code>. Trailing positions are filled with 0. 
</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<h3>Operation</h3> 
 
The normal flow of the particle data operations is: 
 
<ol> 
 
<li> 
When a <code>Pythia</code> object <code>pythia</code> is created, the 
<code>pythia.particleData</code> member is asked to scan the 
<code>ParticleData.xml</code> file. 
 
<p/> 
All lines beginning with <code>&lt;particle</code> are scanned for 
information on a particle species, and all lines beginning with 
<code>&lt;channel</code> are assumed to contain a decay channel of the 
enclosing particle. In both cases XML syntax is used, with attributes 
used to identify the stored properties, and with omitted properties 
defaulting back to 0 where meaningful. The particle and channel 
information may be split over several lines, up to the &gt; endtoken. 
The format of a <code>&lt;particle</code> tag is: 
<pre> 
    &lt;particle id="..." name="..." antiName="..." spinType="..." chargeType="..." colType="..." 
       m0="..." mWidth="..." mMin="..." mMax="..." tau0="..."&gt; 
    &lt;/particle&gt; 
</pre> 
where the fields are the properties already introduced above. 
Note that <code>isResonance</code>, <code>mayDecay</code>, 
<code>doExternalDecay</code>, <code>isVisible</code> and 
<code>doForceWidth</code> are not set here, but are provided with 
default values by the rules described above. Once initialized, also 
these latter properties can be changed, see below.<br/> 
 
The format of  a <code>&lt;channel></code> tag is: 
<pre> 
    &lt;channel onMode="..." bRatio="..." meMode="..." products="..." /&gt; 
</pre> 
again see properties above. The products are given as a blank-separated 
list of <code>id</code> codes. 
<note>Important</note>: the values in the <code>.xml</code> file should not 
be changed, except by the PYTHIA authors. Any changes should be done 
with the help of the methods described below. 
</li> 
 
<li> <p/> 
Between the creation of the <code>Pythia</code> object and the 
<code>init</code> call for it, you may use the methods of the 
<code>ParticleData</code> class to modify some of the default values. 
Several different approaches can be chosen for this. 
 
<p/> 
a) Inside your main program you can directly set values with 
<pre> 
    pythia.readString(string); 
</pre> 
where both the variable name and the value are contained inside 
the character string, separated by blanks and/or a =, e.g. 
<pre> 
    pythia.readString("111:mayDecay = off"); 
</pre> 
switches off the decays of the <ei>pi^0</ei>.<br/> 
 
The particle id (> 0) and the property to be changed must be given, 
separated by a colon.<br/> 
 
The allowed properties are: <code>name</code>, <code>antiName</code>, 
<code>spinType</code>, <code>chargeType</code>, <code>colType</code>, 
<code>m0</code>, <code>mWidth</code>, <code>mMin</code>, 
<code>mMax</code>, <code>tau0</code>, <code>isResonance</code>, 
<code>mayDecay</code>, <code>doExternalDecay</code>, 
<code>isVisible</code> and <code>doForceWidth</code>. All of these 
names are case-insensitive. Names that do not match an existing 
variable are ignored.<br/> 
 
Strings beginning with a non-alphanumeric character, like # or !, 
are assumed to be comments and are not processed at all. For 
<code>bool</code> values, the following notation may be used 
interchangeably: <code>true = on = yes = ok = 1</code>, while everything 
else gives <code>false</code> (including but not limited to 
<code>false</code>, <code>off</code>, <code>no</code> and 
<code>0</code>). 
 
<p/> 
Particle data often comes in sets of closely related information. 
Therefore some properties expect the value to consist of several 
numbers. These can then be separated by blanks (or by commas). 
A simple example is <code>names</code>, which expects both the 
name and antiname to be given. A more interesting one is the 
<code>all</code> property, 
<pre> 
    id:all = name antiName spinType chargeType colType m0 mWidth mMin mMax tau0 
</pre> 
where all the current information on the particle itself is replaced, 
but any decay channels are kept unchanged. Using <code>new</code> instead 
of <code>all</code> also removes any previous decay channels. 
If the string contains fewer fields than expected the trailing 
properties are set to vanish ("void", 0 or 0.). Note that such a 
truncated string should not be followed by a comment, since this 
comment would then be read in as if it contained the missing properties. 
The truncation can be done anywhere, specifically a string with only 
<code>id:new</code> defines a new "empty" particle. 
As before, <code>isResonance</code>, <code>mayDecay</code>, 
<code>doExternalDecay</code>, <code>isVisible</code> and 
<code>doForceWidth</code> are (re)set to their default values, and 
would have to be changed separately if required. 
 
<p/> 
A further command is <code>rescaleBR</code>, which rescales each of the 
existing branching ratios with a common factor, such that their new 
sum is the provided value. This may be a first step towards adding 
new decay channels, see further below. 
 
<p/> 
Alternatively the <code>id</code> code may be followed by another integer, 
which then gives the decay channel number. This then has to be 
followed by the property specific to this channel, either 
<code>onMode</code>, <code>bRatio</code>, <code>meMode</code> or 
<code>products</code>. In the latter case all the products of 
the channel should be given: 
<pre> 
    id:channel:products =  product1 product2 .... 
</pre> 
The line will be scanned until the end of the line, or until a 
non-number word is encountered, or until the maximum allowed number 
of eight products is encountered, whichever happens first. (Thus the 
multiplicity of a decay channel need not be input; it is automatically 
calculated from the products list.) It is also possible to replace all 
the properties of a channel in a similar way: 
<pre> 
    id:channel:all = onMode bRatio meMode product1 product2 .... 
</pre> 
To add a new channel at the end, use 
<pre> 
    id:addChannel = onMode bRatio meMode product1 product2 .... 
</pre> 
 
<p/> 
It is currently not possible to remove a channel selectively, but 
setting its branching ratio vanishing is as effective. If you want to 
remove all existing channels and force decays into one new channel 
you can use 
<pre> 
    id:oneChannel = onMode bRatio meMode product1 product2 .... 
</pre> 
 A first <code>oneChannel</code> command could be followed by 
several subsequent <code>addChannel</code> ones, to build 
up a completely new decay table for an existing particle. 
 
<p/> 
When adding new channels or changing branching ratios in general, 
note that, once a particle is to be decayed, the sum of branching 
ratios is always rescaled to unity. Beforehand, <code>rescaleBR</code> 
may be used to rescale an existing branching ratio by the given factor. 
 
<p/> 
There are a few commands that will study all the decay channels of the 
given particle, to switch them on or off as desired. The 
<pre> 
    id:onMode = onMode 
</pre> 
will set the <code>onMode</code> property of all channels to the 
desired value. The 
<pre> 
    id:offIfAny   = product1 product2 .... 
    id:onIfAny    = product1 product2 .... 
    id:onPosIfAny = product1 product2 .... 
    id:onNegIfAny = product1 product2 .... 
</pre> 
will set the <code>onMode</code> 0, 1, 2 or 3, respectively, for all 
channels which contain any of the enumerated products, where the matching 
to these products is done without distinction of particles and 
antiparticles. Note that "<code>Pos</code>" and "<code>Neg</code>" 
are slightly misleading since it refers to the particle and antiparticle 
of the <code>id</code> species rather than charge, but should still be 
simpler to remember and understand than alternative notations. 
Correspondingly 
<pre> 
    id:offIfAll   = product1 product2 .... 
    id:onIfAll    = product1 product2 .... 
    id:onPosIfAll = product1 product2 .... 
    id:onNegIfAll = product1 product2 .... 
</pre> 
will set the <code>onMode</code> 0, 1, 2 or 3, respectively, for all 
channels which contain all of the enumerated products, again without 
distinction of particles and antiparticles. If the same product appears 
twice in the list it must also appear twice in the decay channel, and 
so on. The decay channel is allowed to contain further particles, 
beyond the product list. By contrast, 
<pre> 
    id:offIfMatch   = product1 product2 .... 
    id:onIfMatch    = product1 product2 .... 
    id:onPosIfMatch = product1 product2 .... 
    id:onPosIfMatch = product1 product2 .... 
</pre> 
requires the decay-channel multiplicity to agree with that of the product 
list, but otherwise works as the <code>onIfAll/offIfAll</code> methods. 
 
<p/> 
Note that the action of several of the commands depends on the order 
in which they are executed, as one would logically expect. For instance, 
<code>id:oneChannel</code> removes all decay channels of <code>id</code> 
and thus all previous changes in this decay table, while subsequent 
additions or changes would still take effect. Another example would be that 
<code>23:onMode = off</code> followed by <code>23:onIfAny = 1 2 3 4 5</code> 
would let the <ei>Z^0</ei> decay to quarks, while no decays would be 
allowed if the order were to be reversed. 
 
<p/> 
b) The <code>Pythia</code> <code>readString(string)</code> method actually 
does not do changes itself, but sends on the string either to the 
<code>ParticleData</code> class or to the <code>Settings</code> one, 
depending on whether the string begins with a digit or a letter. 
If desired, it is possible to communicate directly with the corresponding 
<code>ParticleData</code> method: 
<pre> 
    pythia.particleData.readString("111:mayDecay = off"); 
    pythia.particleData.readString("15:2:products = 16 -211"); 
</pre> 
In this case, changes intended for <code>Settings</code> would not be 
understood. 
 
<p/> 
c) Underlying this are commands for all the individual properties in 
the <code>ParticleData</code> class, one for each. These are 
further described below. Thus, an example now reads 
<pre> 
    pythia.particleData.mayDecay(111, false); 
</pre> 
Boolean values should here be given as <code>true</code> or 
<code>false</code>. 
 
<p/> 
d) A simpler and more useful way is to collect all your changes 
in a separate file, with one line per change, e.g. 
<pre> 
    111:mayDecay = off 
</pre> 
The file can be read by the 
<pre> 
    pythia.readFile(fileName); 
</pre> 
method, where <code>fileName</code> is a string, e.g. 
<code>pythia.readFile("main.cmnd")</code> (or an <code>istream</code> 
instead of a <code>fileName</code>). Each line is processed as 
described for the string in 2a). This file can freely mix commands to 
the <code>Settings</code> and <code>ParticleData</code> classes. 
</li> 
 
<li> <p/> 
A routine <code>reInit(fileName)</code> is provided, and can be used to 
zero the particle data table and reinitialize it from scratch. 
Such a call might be useful if several subruns are to be made with 
widely different particle data - normally the maps are only built 
from scratch once, namely when the <code>Pythia()</code> object is 
created. Also, there is no other possibility to restore the default 
values, unlike for the settings. 
</li> 
 
<li> <p/> 
You may at any time obtain a listing of all the particle data by calling 
<pre> 
    pythia.particleData.listAll(); 
</pre> 
The listing is by increasing <code>id</code> number. It shows the basic 
quantities introduced above. Some are abbreviated in the header to fit on 
the lines: <code>spn = spinType</code>, <code>chg = chargeType</code>, 
<code>col = colType</code>, <code>res = isResonance</code>, 
<code>dec = mayDecay && canDecay</code> (the latter checks that decay 
channels have been defined), <code>ext = doExternalDecay</code>, 
<code>vis = isVisible</code> and <code>wid = doForceWidth</code>.<br/> 
 
To list only those particles that were changed (one way or another, the 
listing will not tell what property or decay channel was changed), instead use 
<pre> 
    pythia.particleData.listChanged(); 
</pre> 
(This info is based on a further <code>hasChanged</code> flag of a particle 
or a channel, set <code>true</code> whenever any of the changing methods are 
used. It is possible to manipulate this value, but this is not recommended.) 
By default the internal initialization of the widths of resonances such as 
<ei>gamma^*/Z^0, W^+-, t/tbar, H^0</ei> do not count as changes; if you want 
to list also those changes instead call <code>listChanged(true)</code>. 
<br/> 
 
To list only one particle, give its <code>id</code> code as argument to 
the <code>list(...)</code> function.. To list a restricted set of particles, 
give in their <code>id</code> codes to <code>list(...)</code> as a 
<code>vector&lt;int></code>. 
</li> 
 
<li> <p/> 
For wholesale changes of particle properties all available data can be 
written out, edited, and then read back in again. These methods are 
mainly intended for expert users. You can choose between two alternative 
syntaxes. 
 
<p/> 
a) XML syntax, using the <code>&lt;particle</code> and 
<code>&lt;channel</code> lines already described. You use the method 
<code>particleData.listXML(fileName)</code> to produce such an XML 
file and <code>particleData.readXML(fileName)</code> to read it back 
in after editing. 
 
<p/> 
b) Fixed/free format, using exactly the same information as illustrated 
for the <code>&lt;particle</code> and <code>&lt;channel</code> lines 
above, but now without any tags. This means that all information fields 
must be provided (if there is no antiparticle then write 
<code>void</code>), in the correct order (while the order is irrelevant 
with XML syntax), and all on one line. Information is written out in 
properly lined-up columns, but the reading is done using free format, 
so fields need only be separated by at least one blank. Each new particle 
is supposed to be separated by (at least) one blank line, whereas no 
blank lines are allowed between the particle line and the subsequent 
decay channel lines, if any.  You use the method 
<code>particleData.listFF(fileName)</code> to produce such a fixed/free 
file and <code>particleData.readFF(fileName)</code> to read it back 
in after editing. 
 
<p/> 
As an alternative to the <code>readXML</code> and <code>readFF</code> 
methods you can also use the 
<code>particleData.reInit(fileName, xmlFormat)</code> method, where 
<code>xmlFormat = true</code> (default) corresponds to reading an XML 
file and <code>xmlFormat = false</code> to a fixed/free format one. 
 
<p/> 
To check that the new particle and decay tables makes sense, you can use 
the <code>particleData.checkTable()</code> method, either directly or by 
switching it on among the standard 
<aloc href="ErrorChecks">error checks</aloc>. 
</li> 
 
</ol> 
 
<h2>The public methods</h2> 
 
In the following we present briefly the public methods in the three 
classes used to build up the particle database. The order 
is top-down, i.e from the full table of all particles to a single 
particle to a single channel. 
Note that these methods usually are less elegant and safe than the 
input methods outlined above. If you use any of these methods, it is 
likely to be the ones in the full database, i.e. the first ones to be 
covered in the following. 
 
<p/> 
For convenience, we have grouped related input and output methods 
together. It should be obvious from the context which is which: 
the input is of type <code>void</code> and has an extra last argument, 
namely is the input value, while the output method returns a 
quantity of the expected type. 
 
<h3>The ParticleData methods</h3> 
 
<method name="ParticleData::ParticleData()"> 
the constructor has no arguments and does not do anything. Internal. 
</method> 
 
<method name="ParticleData& operator=( const ParticleData& particleDataIn)"> 
copy the database from an existing <code>ParticleData</code> object. 
Can be useful when running with multiple <code>Pythia</code> instances. 
Does not include the links to the resonance decay handling set up by 
<code>initWidths(...)</code>. 
</method> 
 
<method name="void ParticleData::initPtr(Info* infoPtr, 
Settings* settingsPtrIn, Rndm* rndmPtrIn, CoupSM* coupSMPtrIn)"> 
initialize pointers to a few other classes. Internal. 
</method> 
 
<method name="bool ParticleData::init(string 
startFile = &quot;../share/Pythia8/xmldoc/ParticleData.xml&quot;)"> 
read in an XML-style file with particle data and initialize the 
particle data tables accordingly. This command is executed 
in the <code>Pythia</code> constructor, i.e. is mainly for 
internal use. 
<argument name="startFile" default ="../share/Pythia8/xmldoc/ParticleData.xml"> 
the name of the data file to be read. When called from the 
<code>Pythia</code> constructor the directory is provided by the

which has the default value &quot;../share/Pythia8/xmldoc&quot;. 
</argument> 
</method> 
 
<method name="bool ParticleData::init(const ParticleData& particleDataIn">

<method name="bool ParticleData::init(istream& is"> 
copy particle data from a stream (rather than from a file). 
</method> 
 
<method name="bool ParticleData::reInit(string startFile, 
bool xmlFormat = true)"> 
overwrite the existing database by reading from the specified file. 
Unlike <code>init</code> above this method is not called by the 
<code>Pythia</code> constructor, but is entirely intended for users 
who want to replace the existing particle data with their own. 
<argument name="startFile">the path and name of file to be read. 
</argument> 
<argument name="xmlFormat">if true read the same kind of XML-style file

</method> 
 
<method name="void ParticleData::initWidths( 
vector&lt;ResonanceWidths*&gt; resonancePtrs)"> 
initialize Breit-Wigner shape parameters for all particles, 
and the detailed handling of resonances, i.e. particles with 
perturbatively calculable partial widths, which can be used to 
obtain a mass-dependent Breit-Wigner and a dynamic choice of 
decay channels. Called from <code>Pythia::init()</code>. 
</method> 
 
<method name="bool ParticleData::readXML(string inFile, 
bool reset = true)"> 
</method> 
<methodmore name="void ParticleData::listXML(string outFile)"> 
read in XML-style data from a file or write it out to a file. For the

write a warning message or not whenever the instruction does not make 
sense, e.g. if the particle does not exist in the database.

lists all particle data, the second only data for those particles that 
were changed after the original creation of the particle data table. 
Resonances are a special case since they can get their data changed 
by being linked to an object that does the calculation of branching

have been processed by the <code>ParticleData</code> instance, for a

<h3>The ParticleDataEntry methods</h3> 
 
Most of the methods that can be applied to a single 
<code>ParticleDataEntry</code> object are almost identical with 
those used above for the <code>ParticleData</code>, except 
that the <code>id</code> argument is no longer needed to find 
the right entry in the table. By and large, this makes direct 
access to the <code>ParticleDataEntry</code> methods superfluous. 
There are a few methods that are unique to each class, however. 
Furthermore, to avoid some naming ambiguities, many methods that 
set values begin with <code>set</code>. 
 
<method name="ParticleDataEntry::ParticleDataEntry(int id = 0,

double mMin = 0., double mMax = 0., double tau0 = 0.)"> 
there are two alternative constructors, that both expect the 
properties of a particle as input. The first assumes that there 
is only one particle, the latter that there is a

The properties stored in an individual decay channel can be set or get 
by the methods in this section. 
 
<method name="DecayChannel::DecayChannel(int onMode = 0, 
double bRatio = 0., int meMode = 0, int prod0 = 0, int prod1 = 0,
