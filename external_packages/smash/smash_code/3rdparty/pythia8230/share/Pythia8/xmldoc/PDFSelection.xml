<chapter name="PDF Selection"> 
 
<h2>PDF Selection</h2> 
 
This page contains several subsections. The first deals with how to 
pick the parton distribution set for protons, including from LHAPDF, 
to be used for all proton and antiproton beams. The second is a special 
option that allows a separate PDF set to be used for the hard process 
only, while the first choice would still apply to everything else. 
The third introduces the possibility of nuclear modifications. 
Further sections give access to pion, Pomeron and photon PDF's, 
respectively, the second being used to describe diffractive systems. 
Towards the end comes the possibility to switch off the lepton 
"parton density", and photons from lepton beams. More information 
on PDF classes is found <aloc href="PartonDistributions">here</aloc>. 
 
<flag name="PDF:extrapolate" default="off"> 
Allow PDF sets to be extrapolated to small <ei>x</ei> values, instead of 
being frozen at <ei>x_min</ei>. This is a global flag that affects all 
PDF sets used, whenever extrapolation has been implemented. Among 
internal PDFs, all Pomeron sets are affected by this flag, as are 
the CTEQ6/CT09 proton ones, the NNPDF 3.1 ones and others accessed 
by the <code>LHAGrid1</code> approach. For the rest some by default 
extrapolate to small <ei>x</ei> (GRV 94 L, MRST/MSTW) while others are 
frozen at the border (CTEQ 5 L, NNPDF 2.3). When in doubt, check whether 
and how the behaviour depends on the choice made for your region of 
interest. When LHAPDF (5 or 6) is used, the extrapolation switch is set 
according to the choice here, and the behaviour is according to the 
rules of the respective program. 
<br/>To put the issue in context, parton densities have a guaranteed 
range of validity in <ei>x</ei> and <ei>Q^2</ei>, and what should be done 
beyond that range usually is not explained by the authors of PDF sets. 
Nevertheless these boundaries very often are exceeded, e.g. minimum-bias 
studies at LHC may sample <ei>x</ei> values down to <ei>10^-8</ei>, while 
many PDF sets stop already at <ei>10^-5</ei>. The default behaviour is 
then that the PDF's are frozen at the boundary, i.e. <ei>xf(x,Q^2)</ei> is 
fixed at its value at <ei>x_min</ei> for all values <ei>x &lt; 
x_min</ei>, and so on. This is a conservative approach. Alternatively, 
if you switch on extrapolation, then parametrizations will be extended 
beyond the boundaries, by some prescription. In some cases this will 
provide a more realistic answer, in others complete rubbish. Another 
problem is that some of the PDF-set codes will write a warning message 
anytime the limits are exceeded, thus swamping your output 
file. Therefore you should study a set seriously before you run it 
with this switch on. 
<note>Warning:</note>It has been found out that the LHAPDF program by 
default uses a damping of PDFs at low <ei>Q</ei> scales, below 
<ei>Q_min</ei>, based on an anomalous dimension ansatz. This overlaps 
with the damping imposed in the MPI framework by the <ei>p_T0</ei> 
parameter, and to have both would probably imply doublecounting of 
effects. Therefore, as of version 8.227, PDFs are frozen below 
<ei>Q_min</ei>. This change affects the LHAPDF 5 interface. The native 
LHAPDF 6 interface already contained this restriction, as does the PDFs 
that come with PYTHIA. Also limits at <ei>Q_max</ei> and <ei>x_max</ei> 
are checked and PDFs frozen outside them, so the extrapolate option now 
is strictly a choice of low-<ei>x</ei> behaviour. 
</flag> 
 
<h3>Parton densities for protons</h3> 
 
PYTHIA comes with a reasonably complete list of recent LO fits built-in, 
both ones within the normal LO context and ones with modifications for 
better matching to event generators. In addition two older sets are 
included for backwards reference (most studies to date are based on 
CTEQ 5L). Therefore there is no real need to link any external PDF sets. 
 
<p/> 
If the internal PDF sets are not sufficient, the 
<a href="http://projects.hepforge.org/lhapdf/" target="page">LHAPDF 
library</a> <ref>Wha05,Buc15</ref> gives you access to a much wider 
selection. 
<note>Warning 1:</note> owing to previous problems with the behaviour 
of PDF's beyond the <ei>x</ei> and <ei>Q^2</ei> boundaries of a set, 
you should only use LHAPDF <b>version 5.3.0 or later</b>. 
<note>Warning 2:</note> the behaviour of the LHAPDF sets need not be 
identical with the implementation found in PYTHIA. Specifically we 
are aware of the following points that may influence a comparison. 
<br/>(a) CTEQ 5L in PYTHIA is the parametrization, in LHAPDF the grid 
interpolation. 
<br/>(b) MRST LO* and LO** in PYTHIA is based on an updated edition, 
where one makes use of the expanded MSTW grid format, while LHAPDF 
is based on the original smaller grid. 
<br/>(c) The CTEQ 6 and CT09MC sets in PYTHIA are frozen at the 
boundaries of the grid, by recommendation of the authors, while 
LHAPDF also offers an option with a smooth extrapolation outside 
the grid boundaries. 
 
<p/> 
If you do not want to install LHAPDF, it is possible to use LHAPDF6 
data grids natively in PYTHIA. This is based on a simplified 
implementation of interpolation in a <code>.dat</code> "lhagrid1" 
file, and so does not give fully identical results, and also is not 
foolproof. 
 
<p/> 
The selection of parton densities is made once and then is propagated 
through the program. It is essential to make an informed choice, 
for several reasons <ref>Kas10</ref>: 
<note>Warning 1:</note> the choice of PDF set affects a number of 
properties of events. A change of PDF therefore requires a complete 
retuning e.g.  of the multiparton-interactions model for minimum-bias and 
underlying events. Conversely, the 
<aloc href="Tunes">pp physics tunes</aloc> are all made for a specific 
PDF tune, and the chosen (or default) tune will therefore overwrite 
the <code>PDF:pSet</code> default value described below. If you want 
to set <code>PDF:pSet</code> differently it should be done <i>after</i> 
the <code>Tune:pp</code> value, if any, has been set. 
<note>Warning 2:</note> People often underestimate the differences 
between different sets on the market. The sets for the same order are 
constructed to behave more or less similarly at large <ei>x</ei> and 
<ei>Q^2</ei>, while the multiparton interactions are dominated by the 
behaviour in the region of small <ei>x</ei> and <ei>Q^2</ei>. A good 
PDF parametrization ought to be sensible down to <ei>x = 10^-6</ei> 
(<ei>x = 10^-7</ei>) and <ei>Q^2 = 1</ei> GeV^2 for Tevatron (LHC) 
applications. Unfortunately there are distributions on the market that 
completely derail in that region. The <code>main51.cc</code> and 
<code>main52.cc</code> programs in the <code>examples</code> 
subdirectory provide some examples of absolutely minimal sanity checks 
before a new PDF set is put in production. 
<note>Warning 3:</note> NLO and LO sets tend to have quite different 
behaviours, e.g. NLO ones have less gluons at small x, which then is 
compensated by positive corrections in the NLO matrix elements. 
Therefore do not blindly assume that an NLO tune has to be better than 
an LO one when combined with the LO matrix elements in PYTHIA. There are 
explicit examples where such thinking can lead you down the wrong alley, 
especially if you study low-<ei>pT</ei> physics. A longer discussion on 
this point can be found in <a href="../pdfdoc/pdfwarning.pdf">this note</a>. 
In the list below you should therefore be extra cautious when using 
set 6 or set 9.

<h3>Parton densities for protons in the hard process</h3> 
 
The above options provides a PDF set that will be used everywhere: 
for the hard process, the parton showers and the multiparton interactions 
alike. As already mentioned, therefore a change of PDF should be 
accompanied by a <b>complete</b> retuning of the whole MPI framework, 
and maybe more. There are cases where one may want to explore 
different PDF options for the hard process, but would not want to touch 
the rest. If several different sets are to be compared, a simple 
reweighting based on the <aloc href="EventInformation">originally 
used</aloc> flavour, <ei>x</ei>, <ei>Q^2</ei> and PDF values may offer the 
best route. The options in this section allow a choice of the PDF set 
for the hard process alone, while the choice made in the previous section 
would still be used for everything else. The hardest interaction 
of the minimum-bias process is part of the multiparton-interactions 
framework and so does not count as a hard process here. 
 
<p/> 
Of course it is inconsistent to use different PDF's in different parts 
of an event, but if the <ei>x</ei> and <ei>Q^2</ei> ranges mainly accessed 
by the components are rather different then the contradiction would not be 
too glaring. Furthermore, since standard PDF's are one-particle-inclusive 
we anyway have to 'invent' our own PDF modifications to handle configurations 
where more than one parton is kicked out of the proton <ref>Sjo04</ref>. 
 
<p/> 
The PDF choices that can be made are the same as above, so we do not 
repeat the detailed discussion. 
 
<flag name="PDF:useHard" default="off"> 
If on then select a separate PDF set for the hard process, using the 
variables below. If off then use the same PDF set for everything, 
as already chosen above. 
</flag> 
 
<word name="PDF:pHardSet" default="void"> 
Parton densities to be used by the proton beams of the hard process, 
with the same options available as for <code>PDF:pSet</code>. If this 
option is set to <code>void</code> then the same PDF set 
as <code>PDF:pSet</code> is used. 
</word> 
 
<word name="PDF:pHardSetB" default="void"> 
Parton densities to be used by <ei>proton beam B</ei> of the hard 
process, with the same options available as 
for <code>PDF:pSet</code>. If this option is set to <code>void</code> 
then the same PDF set as <code>PDF:pHardSet</code> is used. 
</word> 
 
<h3>Nuclear modifications of parton densities</h3> 
 
<p/> 
Nuclear modifications of the PDFs are implemented for the hard-process 
generation only. The final PDF value is calculated for an average nucleon 
within given nucleus, i.e. 
<ei>f_i^A(x,Q^2) = (Z/A)*f_i^(p/A) + ((A-Z)/A)*f_i^(n/A)</ei>, where 
<ei>A</ei> is the nuclear mass number and <ei>Z</ei> the number of protons, 
set using the PDG code for nucleus. The neutron PDFs are obtained by 
applying isospin symmetry, e.g. <ei>f_u^(n/A)(x,Q^2) = f_d^(p/A)(x,Q^2)</ei>. 
The nuclear PDFs implemented provide only the nuclear modification so the 
full PDF is calculated by multiplying the selected free proton PDF with the 
modication.

<h3>Parton densities for pions</h3> 
 
The parton densities of the pion are considerably less well known than 
those of the proton. There are only rather few sets on the market, 
and none particularly recent. Only one comes built-in, but others can 
be accessed from LHAPDF. Input parametrizations are for the <ei>pi+</ei>. 
>From this the <ei>pi-</ei> is obtained by charge conjugation and the 
<ei>pi0</ei> from averaging (half the pions have <ei>d dbar</ei> 
valence quark content, half <ei>u ubar</ei>. 
 
<p/> 
Much of the switches are taken over from the proton case, with obvious 
modifications; therefore the description is briefer. Currently we have 
not seen the need to allow separate parton densities for hard processes. 
When using LHAPDF the <code>PDF:extrapolateLHAPDF</code> switch of the 
proton also applies to pions. 
 
<word name="PDF:piSet" default="1">

<h3>Parton densities for Pomerons</h3> 
 
The Pomeron is introduced in the description of diffractive events, 
i.e. a diffractive system is viewed as a Pomeron-proton collision at a 
reduced CM energy. Here the PDF's are even less well known. 
Most experimental parametrizations are NLO, which makes them less 
well suited for Monte Carlo applications. Furthermore note that 
the momentum sum is arbitrarily normalized to a non-unity value. 
 
<word name="PDF:PomSet" default="6">

set separately for the gluon and the quark distributions. The 
momentum fraction of gluons and quarks can be freely mixed, and 
production of <ei>s</ei> quarks can be suppressed relative to 
that of <ei>d</ei> and <ei>u</ei> ones, with antiquarks as likely 
as quarks. See further below how to set the six parameters of this

<h3>Parton densities for photons</h3> 
 
Photon PDFs describe the partonic content of the resolved photons and 
can be used to generate any process initiated by quarks and gluons. 
 
<p/> 
There are several PDF sets available for photons, although there have not 
been much activity recently. Currently one internal set is included, but 
more sets are available from LHAPDF5. The sets from LHAPDF5 can only be 
used as PDFs in the hard process (see <code>PDF:GammaHardSet</code> below). 
In case of photons the parton shower and beam remnant generation 
require additional methods that are provided only for internal sets. 
Currently no photon PDFs have been included in LHAPDF6. 
 
<modepick name="PDF:GammaSet" default="1" min="1" max="1"> 
Parton densities that can be used for resolved photon beams. 
<option value="1"> CJKL, based on <ref>Cor03</ref> but the rescaling 
for heavy quarks due to kinematic constraints in DIS is undone to obtain 
correct behaviour for photon-photon/hadron collisions.</option> 
</modepick> 
 
<word name="PDF:GammaHardSet" default="void"> 
Parton densities to be used by the beams of the hard process. For photons 
the other options are the ones provided by LHAPDF5. If this option is set 
to <code>void</code> then the same PDF set as <code>PDF:GammaSet</code> is 
used. 
</word> 
 
<h3>Parton densities for leptons</h3> 
 
For electrons/muons/taus there is no need to choose between different 
parametrizations, since only one implementation is available, and 
should be rather uncontroversial (apart from some technical details). 
However, insofar as e.g. <ei>e^+ e^-</ei> data often are corrected 
back to a world without any initial-state photon radiation, it is 
useful to have a corresponding option available here. 
 
<flag name="PDF:lepton" default="on"> 
Use parton densities for lepton beams or not. If off the colliding 
leptons carry the full beam energy, if on part of the energy is 
radiated away by initial-state photons. In the latter case the 
initial-state showers will generate the angles and energies of the 
set of photons that go with the collision. In addition one collinear 
photon per beam carries any leftover amount of energy not described 
by shower emissions. If the initial-state showers are switched off 
these collinear photons will carry the full radiated energy. 
</flag> 
 
<p/> 
Neutrinos are always taken pointlike. Do note that the phase space 
selection machinery currently does not allow one resolved and one 
unresolved lepton beam. For lepton-neutrino collisions to work you must 
therefore set <code>PDF:lepton = off</code>. 
 
<h4>Photons from lepton beams</h4> 
 
Lepton beams can emit photons and therefore may have partonic 
content. The PDFs describing these can be obtained by convoluting 
the photon flux with the selected photon PDFs. The photon flux 
is modelled according to equivalent photon approximation (EPA) which 
gives the flux of bremsstrahlung photons. 
 
<flag name="PDF:lepton2gamma" default="off"> 
Gives photon beams from leptons. Both, unresolved (direct) and resolved 
contributions are included, see <aloc href="Photoproduction"> 
Photoproduction</aloc> for details. Can be used only with charged leptons. 
The applied photon PDF set is selected with the <code>PDF:GammaSet</code> 
and <code>PDF:GammaHardSet</code> options above. Events with two unresolved 
photon initiators can be generated also with the <code>PDF:lepton = on</code> 
but then additional phase-space cuts (e.g. cut on the invariant mass of the 
photon-photon pair) are not applied. 
</flag> 
 
<modepick name="PDF:lepton2gammaSet" default="1" min="1" max="2"> 
The type of photon flux. 
<option value="1"> Convolute the photon flux from EPA with the selected photon 
PDF set. Convolution integral is performed "on the fly", meaning that the 
actual integral is not computed but the <ei>x_gamma</ei> is sampled 
event-by-event. Since the final PDF value depends on the sampled value for 
<ei>x_gamma</ei> the phase-space sampling is set up using an overestimate for 
the PDFs. This makes the process selection somewhat less efficient compared 
to the case where the PDFs are fixed (e.g. for protons).</option> 
<option value="2"> Uses an approximation of the photon flux to sample 
processes and corrects this later with an externally provided flux. For 
leptons a bit less efficient than option 1 but allows straightforward 
implementation of photon fluxes from different particles. To use this option 
user has to provide the external photon flux using method 
<code>Pythia::setPhotonFluxPtr(PDF*, PDF*)</code> as demostrated in the 
sample program <code>main70.cc</code>. </option> 
</modepick> 
 
<h3>Incoming parton selection</h3> 
 
There is one useful degree of freedom to restrict the set of incoming 
quark flavours for hard processes. It does not change the PDF's as such, 
only which quarks are allowed to contribute to the hard-process cross 
sections. Note that separate but similarly named modes are available 
for multiparton interactions and spacelike showers. 
 
<modeopen name="PDFinProcess:nQuarkIn" default="5" min="0" max="5"> 
Number of allowed incoming quark flavours in the beams; a change 
to 4 would thus exclude <ei>b</ei> and <ei>bbar</ei> as incoming 
partons, etc. 
</modeopen>
