<h2>Random-Number Seed</h2> 
 
The seed of the random number generator can be set as follows: 
 
<a name="anchor1"></a>
<p/><code>flag&nbsp; </code><strong> Random:setSeed &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>off</strong></code>)<br/>
Indicates whether a user-set seed should be used every time the 
<code>Pythia::init</code> routine is called. If off, the random number 
generator is initialized with its default seed at the beginning 
of the run, and never again. If on, each new <code>Pythia::init</code> 
call (should several be made in the same run) results in the random 
number being re-initialized, thereby possibly starting over with the 
same sequence, if you do not watch out. 
   
 
<a name="anchor2"></a>
<p/><code>mode&nbsp; </code><strong> Random:seed &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>-1</strong></code>; <code>maximum = 900000000</code>)<br/>
The seed to be used, if <code>setSeed</code> is on.<br/> 
A negative value gives the default seed,<br/> 
a value 0 gives a random seed based on the time, and<br/> 
a value between 1 and 900,000,000 a unique different random number 
sequence.

This includes methods to save and restore the state of the generator, 
and some preprogrammed methods to generate non-uniform random numbers.
