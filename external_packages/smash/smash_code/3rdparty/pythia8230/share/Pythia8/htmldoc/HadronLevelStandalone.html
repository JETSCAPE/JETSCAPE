<h2>Hadron-Level Standalone</h2> 
 
The Les Houches Accord allows external process-level configurations 
to be fed in, for subsequent parton-level and hadron-level generation 
to be handled internally by PYTHIA. There is no correspondingly 
standardized interface if you have external events that have also 
been generated through the parton-level stage, so that only the 
hadron-level remains to be handled. A non-standard way to achieve this 
exists, however, and can be useful both for real applications and 
for various tests of the hadronization model on its own. 
 
<p/> 
The key trick is to set the flag <code>ProcessLevel:all = off</code>. 
When <code>pythia.next()</code> is called it then does not try to 
generate a hard process. Since there are no beams, it is also not 
possible to perform the normal <code>PartonLevel</code> step. 
(It is still possible to generate final-state radiation, but this 
is not automatic. It would have to be done by hand, using the 
<code>pythia.forceTimeShower(...)</code> method, before 
<code>pythia.next()</code> is called.) 
Thus only the <code>HadronLevel</code> methods are 
called, to take the current content of the event record stored in 
<code>pythia.event</code> as a starting point for any hadronization 
and decays that are allowed by the normal parameters of this step. 
Often the input would consist solely of partons grouped into colour 
singlets, but also (colour-singlet) particles are allowed. 
 
<p/> 
To set up all the parameters, a <code>pythia.init()</code> call has 
to be used, without any arguments. In brief, the structure of the 
main program therefore should be something like 
<pre> 
  Pythia pythia;                               // Declare generator. 
  Event& event = pythia.event                  // Convenient shorthand. 
  pythia.readString("ProcessLevel:all = off"); // The trick! 
  pythia.init();                               // Initialization. 
  for (int iEvent = 0; iEvent &lt; nEvent; ++iEvent) { 
    // Insert filling of event here! 
    pythia.next();                             // Do the hadron level. 
  } 
</pre> 
Of course this should be supplemented by analysis of events, error checks, 
and so on, as for a normal PYTHIA run. The unique aspect is how to fill 
the <code>event</code> inside the loop, before <code>pythia.next()</code> 
is called. 
 
<h3>Input configuration</h3> 
 
To set up a new configuration the first step is to throw away the current 
one, with <code>event.reset()</code>. This routine will also reserve 
the zeroth entry in the even record to represent the event as a whole. 
 
<p/> 
With the <code>event.append(...)</code> methods a new entry is added at the 
bottom of the current record, i.e. the first time it is called entry 
number 1 is filled, and so on. The <code>append</code>  method basically 
exists in four variants, either without or with history information, 
and with four-momentum provided either as a <code>Vec4</code> four-vector 
or as four individual components: 
<pre> 
  append( id, status, col, acol, p, m) 
  append( id, status, col, acol, px, py, pz, e, m) 
  append( id, status, mother1, mother2, daughter1, daughter2, col, acol, p, m) 
  append( id, status, mother1, mother2, daughter1, daughter2, col, acol, px, py, pz, e, m) 
</pre> 
The methods return the index at which the entry has been stored, 
but normally you would not use this feature. 
 
<p/> 
All the four methods have two final, optional arguments. The 
<code>scale</code> one is highly relevant if you want to perform parton 
showers in addition to hadronization; see the 
<code>pythia.forceTimeShower()</code> description below. The final 
<code>pol</code> one denotes polarization, and could be used to 
perform polarized <i>tau</i> decays. 
 
<p/> 
You can find descriptions of the input variables 
<a href="ParticleProperties.html" target="page">here</a>. 
The PDG particle code <code>id</code> and the Les Houches Accord colour 
<code>col</code> and anticolour <code>acol</code> tags must be set 
correctly. The four-momentum and mass have to be provided in units of GeV; 
if you omit the mass it defaults to 0. 
 
<p/> 
Outgoing particles that should hadronize should be given status code 23. 
Often this is the only status code you need. You could e.g. also fill in 
incoming partons with -21 and intermediate ones with -22, if you so wish. 
Usually the choice of status codes is not crucial, so long as you recall 
that positive numbers correspond to particles that are still around, while 
negative numbers denote ones that already hadronized or decayed. However, 
so as not to run into contradictions with the internal PYTHIA checks 
(when <code>Check:event = on</code>), or with external formats such as 
HepMC, we do recommend the above codes. When <code>pythia.next()</code> 
is called the positive-status particles that hadronize/decay get the sign 
of the status code flipped to negative but the absolute value is retained. 
The new particles are added with normal PYTHIA status codes. 
 
<p/> 
For normal hadronization/decays in <code>pythia.next()</code> the 
history encoded in the mother and daughter indices is not used. 
Therefore the first two <code>append</code> methods, which set all these 
indices vanishing, should suffice. The subsequent hadronization/decays 
will still be properly documented. 
 
<p/> 
The exception is when you want to include junctions in your string 
topology, i.e. have three string pieces meet. Then you must insert in 
your event record the (decayed) particle that is the reason for the 
presence of a junction, e.g. a baryon beam remnant from which several 
valence quarks have been kicked out, or a neutralino that underwent a 
baryon-number-violating decay. This particle must have as daughters 
the three partons that together carry the baryon number. 
 
<p/> 
When <code>ProcessLevel:all = off</code> the <code>pythia.next()</code> 
call applied to a parton-level confguration will hadronize it, without 
generating any parton showers. Indeed, the point of the framework described 
here is to be able to feed in complete showered parton topologies for 
hadronization. (The exception is if you feed in a resonance, see next 
section.) As an option, however, it is possible to generate a shower 
before the <code>pythia.next()</code> step by using the 
<code>pythia.forceTimeShower( int iBeg, int iEnd, double pTmax, 
int nBranchMax = 0)</code> method. 
Here <code>iBeg</code> and <code>iEnd</code> give the range of partons 
that should be allowed to shower, <code>pTmax</code> the maximum 
<i>pT</i> scale of emissions, and a nonzero <code>nBranchMax</code> 
a maximum number of allowed branchings. Additionally, a <code>scale</code> 
has to be set for each parton that should shower, which requires an 
additional final argument to the <code>append</code> methods above, 
or alternatively separately with the <code>pythia.event[i].scale(...)</code> 
method. This scale limits the maximum <i>pT</i> allowed for each parton, 
in addition to the global <code>pTmax</code>. When not set the scale 
defaults to 0, meaning no radiation for that parton. 
 
<p/> 
The sample program in <code>main21.cc</code> illustrates how you can work 
with this facility, both for simple parton configurations and for more 
complicated ones with junctions, and also how to force a shower. 
 
<p/> 
As an alternative to setting up a topology with the methods above, 
a <a href="LesHouchesAccord.html" target="page">Les Houches Event File</a> (LHEF) 
can also provide the configurations, using the "no-beams" extension. 
For parsing reasons the <code>&lt;init&gt;</code> and 
<code>&lt;/init&gt;</code> tags need to be present as two separate 
lines, but there need not be anything between them. If there is, 
then the beam identities should be picked to be 0. A standard 
<code>&lt;LesHouchesEvents version="1.0"&gt;</code> line must also 
be at the top of the file. For the rest only the 
<code>&lt;event&gt;....&lt;/event&gt;</code> blocks need to be present, 
one for each event. You should select <code>Beams:frameType = 4</code> 
and provide the file name in <code>Beams:LHEF</code>, but setting 
<code>ProcessLevel:all = off</code> here is superfluous since the 
absence of beams is enough to make this apparent. Needless to say, an 
externally linked <code>LHAup</code> class works as well as an LHEF, 
with <code>Beams:frameType = 5</code>. 
 
<p/> 
The event information to store in the LHEF, or provide by the 
<code>LHAup</code>, is essentially the same as above. The only 
difference is in status codes: outgoing particles should have 1 
instead of 23, and intermediate resonances 2 instead of -22. 
Incoming partons, if any, are -1 instead of -21. 
 
<h3>Extensions to resonance decays</h3> 
 
With the above scheme, <code>pythia.next()</code> will generate 
hadronization, i.e. string fragmentation and subsequent decays of 
normal unstable particles. Alternatively it could be used to 
decay <a href="ResonanceDecays.html" target="page">resonances</a>, i.e. 
<i>W, Z</i>, top, Higgs, SUSY and other massive particles. 
 
<p/> 
The default when a resonance is encountered is to decay it, let the 
decay products shower, and finally hadronize the partons. Should a 
decay sequence already be provided at input, this sequence will 
be used as input for the showers, which are handled consecutively, 
followed by hadronization. Thus, a Higgs could be provided alone, 
or decaying to a pair of <i>W</i> bosons, or the same with the 
<i>W</i>'s decaying further to fermion pairs. Needless to say, 
correct process-specific angular correlations in decays should not 
be expected when the process is unspecified. 
 
<p/> 
If you do not want resonances to decay then you can use the 
<code>ProcessLevel:resonanceDecays = off</code> setting. 
If instead you want them to decay but not shower, you can 
use either <code>PartonLevel:FSR = off</code> or 
<code>PartonLevel:FSRinResonances = off</code>. A warning here 
is that, generally, it is not a good idea to provide a part of the 
shower history but not all, e.g. <i> Z^0 &rarr; q qbar g</i>: 
it is not straightforward to avoid doublecouning or other problems 
within this simpler alternative to a full-scale event generation. 
 
<p/> 
The input configuration has to follow the rules described above, 
i.e. <code>ProcessLevel:all = off</code> should be set for internal 
input, but is not necessary for LHEF input. It is possible to combine 
several resonances, and other coloured or uncoloured particles into 
the same event. Partonic daughters of resonances would then shower, 
but other partons not. It may be possible to fool the program, 
however, since this is not a fully tested core functionality, 
so don't combine wildly if there is no reason to. 
 
 
<h3>Repeated hadronization or decay</h3> 
 
An alternative approach is possible with the 
<code>pythia.forceHadronLevel()</code> routine. This method does 
a call to the <code>HadronLevel</code> methods, irrespective of the 
value of the <code>HadronLevel:all</code> flag. If you hadronize 
externally generated events it is equivalent to a 
<code>pythia.next()</code> call with 
<code>ProcessLevel:all = off</code>. 
 
<p/> 
This method truly sticks to the hadron level, and thus cannot handle 
resonance decays. The real application instead is for repeated 
hadronization of the same PYTHIA process- and parton-level event. 
This may for some studies help to save time, given that these two 
first step are more time-consuming than the hadronization one. 
 
<p/> 
For repeated hadronization you should first generate an event as usual, 
but with <code>HadronLevel:all = off</code>. This event you can save 
in a temporary copy, e.g. <code>Event savedEvent = pythia.event</code>. 
Inside a loop you copy back with <code>pythia.event = savedEvent</code>, 
and call <code>pythia.forceHadronLevel()</code> to obtain a new 
hadronization history. 
 
<p/> 
A more limited form of repetition is if you want to decay a given kind 
of particle repeatedly, without having to generate the rest of the event 
anew. This could be the case e.g. in <i>B</i> physics applications. 
Then you can use the <code>pythia.moreDecays()</code> method, which 
decays all particles in the event record that have not been decayed 
but should have been done so. The 
<code>pythia.particleData.mayDecay( id, false/true)</code> method 
may be used to switch off/on the decays of a particle species 
<code>id</code>, so that it is not decayed in the 
<code>pythia.next()</code> call but only inside a loop over a number of 
tries. 
 
<p/> 
Between each loop the newly produced decay products must be 
removed and the decayed particle status restored to undecayed. 
The former is simple, since the new products are appended to the 
end of the event record: <code>event.saveSize()</code> saves the 
initial size of the event record, and <code>event.restoreSize()</code> 
can later be used repeatedly to restore this original size, which means 
that the new particles at the end are thrown away. The latter is more 
complicated, and requires the user to identify the positions of all 
particles of the species and restore a positive status code with 
<code>event[i].statusPos()</code>. 
 
<p/> 
The <code>main15.cc</code> program illustrates both these methods, 
i.e. either repeated hadronization or repeated decay of PYTHIA 
events.
