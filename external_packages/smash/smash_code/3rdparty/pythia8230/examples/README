   LIST OF SAMPLE MAIN PROGRAMS

For a list of the sample main programs, with a brief description
of each of them, see the "Sample Main Programs" in the HTML manual. 
From this examples subdirectory, the list should be located at 
"../share/Pythia8/htmldoc/SampleMainPrograms.html".  
For further details consult the source of each mainNN program.

   BASIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING TEST PROGRAMS

1) You are supposed to have already compiled PYTHIA 8, as described in 
   the README file of the mother directory. For the moment we assume
   that you will NOT use external libraries.

2) You are now ready to test run the first thirty of the mainNN examples,
   see the manual page "Sample main program" for details.
   Type "gmake mainNN" to build an executable "mainNN". 
   Type "./mainNN > output" to run this executable. 
   Then study the output file. The existing files outNN are examples of 
   possible outputs from several runs, so that you can compare.

3) If you want to run your own programs from this directory you can edit
   the "Makefile", adding the name of your main program to the already
   existing ones. Note that different cases exist, depending on which 
   external libraries are to be linked. The mymainNN.cc name series havs 
   been predefined to link to PYTHIA 8 standalone and produce executables 
   mymainNN, so programs with such names are free for you to create and 
   use without having to modify the Makefile.

4) With ./runmains all the 30 first mainNN program will be run,
   to get a thorough test of the installation. 
   The runmains file can easily be edited to run the others as well,
   but then you should first link to the appropriate external libraries.
   The outref subdirectory contains the output of such a run, if you
   want to compare with what you obtain.

5) Type "gmake clean" to clean up the examples directory (but not the
   output files).

6) The variables controlling the location and usage of external
   packages can be set in "Makefile.inc", as described in the mother
   README file.

   ADVANCED INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING TEST PROGRAMS

1) If you want to be able to run examples linked to external packages
   (excluding LHAPDF) you should already have set that up with the
   "./configure" command in the mother directory. If not, you can go
   back and do it now. Make sure to run "make" which will copy the
   generated "Makefile.inc" into this directory.

2) If you want to use LHAPDF (either 5 or 6) this needs to be
   specified with the "./configure" command in the mother
   directory. After running configure, "make" must be run which will
   create the "lib/libpythia8lhapdf[56].so" plugin libraries. Note
   that any example can use LHAPDF PDF sets. However, if the
   "lib/libpythia8lhapdf[56].so" libraries cannot be found, then the
   program will exit with an error.

3) The LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable does not need to be set when running
   these examples (unlike the behavior for PYTHIA 8.1). However, the
   PYTHIA 8 installation must either exist on the paths specified by
   "PREFIX_LIB" and "PREFIX_INCLUDE" in the "Makefile.inc" (which is
   automatically generated by the "configure" script) or along the
   path "../".

4) If you want to change external package versions (other than
   LHAPDF), simply change the relevant paths in the "Makefile.inc"
   file, or rerun "configure" and "make" in the mother directory. 
   For LHAPDF, "configure" and "make" must be rerun on the mother
   directory.
