! File: main04.cmnd
! This file contains commands to be read in for a Pythia8 run.
! Lines not beginning with a letter or digit are comments.
! Names are case-insensitive  -  but spellings-sensitive!
! The changes here are illustrative, not always physics-motivated.

! 1) Settings used in the main program.
Main:numberOfEvents = 1000         ! number of events to generate
Main:timesAllowErrors = 10         ! how many aborts before run stops

! 2) Settings related to output in init(), next() and stat().
Init:showChangedSettings = on      ! list changed settings
Init:showChangedParticleData = off ! list changed particle data
Next:numberCount = 500             ! print message every n events
Next:numberShowInfo = 3            ! print event information n times
Next:numberShowProcess = 0         ! print process record n times
Next:numberShowEvent = 0           ! print event record n times

! 3) Beam parameter settings. Values below agree with default ones.
Beams:idA = 2212                   ! first beam, p = 2212, pbar = -2212
Beams:idB = 2212                   ! second beam, p = 2212, pbar = -2212
Beams:eCM = 14000.                 ! CM energy of collision

! 4) Settings for the hard-process generation.
SoftQCD:all = on                   ! Allow total sigma = elastic/SD/DD/ND
! Optionally only study one or a few processes at a time.
#SoftQCD:elastic = on               ! Elastic
#SoftQCD:singleDiffractive = on     ! Single diffractive
#SoftQCD:doubleDiffractive = on     ! Double diffractive
#SoftQCD:centralDiffractive = on    ! Central diffractive
#SoftQCD:nonDiffractive = on        ! Nondiffractive (inelastic)
#SoftQCD:inelastic = on             ! All inelastic

! 5) Optionally switch on hand-set cross section and Coulomb term.
! Note: these values are illustrative only, not to be taken seriously.
#SigmaTotal:setOwn = on             ! set your own total/elastic/diffr. sigma
#SigmaTotal:sigmaTot = 106.         ! total cross section (excluding Coulomb)
#SigmaTotal:sigmaXX = 5.            ! reduce double diffractive cross section
#SigmaElastic:setOwn = on           ! suboption for Coulomb term in elastic
#SigmaElastic:tAbsMin = 4e-5        ! divergence requires lower cutoff

! 6) Optionally select diffractive model.
Diffraction:PomFlux = 5             ! the MBR model for diffraction

! 7) Multiparton interactions and impact parameter picture.
! Note: these values are illustrative only, not to be taken seriously.
MultipartonInteractions:pT0Ref = 2.
MultipartonInteractions:ecmRef = 1960.
MultipartonInteractions:ecmPow = 0.16
MultipartonInteractions:pTmin = 0.2
MultipartonInteractions:bProfile = 2
#MultipartonInteractions:coreRadius = 0.4
#MultipartonInteractions:coreFraction = 0.5
MultipartonInteractions:expPow = 1.

! 8) Other settings. Can be expanded as desired.
! Note: may overwrite some of the values above, so watch out.
#Tune:pp = 6                         ! use Tune 4Cx
