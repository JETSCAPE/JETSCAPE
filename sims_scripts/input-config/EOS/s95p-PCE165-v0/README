These files contain the Equation of State s95p-PCE165-v0 described in
Huovinen and Petreczky, arXiv:0912.2541. Below 184 MeV temperature,
the EoS is based on hadron resonance gas with resonances up to 2 GeV
mass (see the resonance list in pdg05.dat file), and above 184 MeV it
is based on the lattice result by Bazavov et al., Phys.Rev.D80, 014504 (2009).  
Within the temperature interval 165 < T < 184 MeV, the hadron
resonance gas is in chemical equilibrium. Below 165 MeV temperatures,
it is in partial chemical equilibrium with particle ratios fixed to
those in chemical equilibrium at T = 165 MeV.

Note that this is a version 0. In the published version the fit is
done to the N_t=6 lattice data at temperatures 552, 630 and 716
MeV. This version uses only two datapoints of the N_t=6 data, namely
at temperatures 548 and 729 MeV. The parameters of this fit are

   d2 =  0.2588
   d4 =  3.483*10^-3
   c1 = -1.634*10^-6
   c2 =  2.560*10^-28
   n1 =  9
   n2 =  37
   T0 =  184.2 MeV

The differences between this and the published parametrization are
less than 0.5% and thus negligible in any hydrodynamical calculation.

The files

	s95p-PCE165-v0_par1.dat, s95-PCE165-v0_dens1.dat
	s95p-PCE165-v0_par2.dat, s95-PCE165-v0_dens2.dat
	s95p-PCE165-v0_par3.dat, s95-PCE165-v0_dens3.dat

contain the EoS as function of energy density, i.e. on equidistant
energy density grid(s).

All the files begin by two lines with

    e0
    de	ne

where 'e0' is the lowest energy density of the grid, 'de' grid spacing
and 'ne' the number of grid points, i.e. lines.

In the *par*.dat files the thermodynamical parameters,
temperature (in GeV, first row) and chemical potentials are tabulated
from the third line on. The *dens*.dat files contain the
densities from the third line on. First line is energy density (in
GeV/fm^3), second pressure (in GeV/fm^3), third entropy density (in
fm^-3), fourth net baryon density (in fm^-3) and the fifth a plasma
fraction of the fluid (zero below 184 MeV, one above 220 MeV, lineary
proportional to temperature in the transition region 184 < T < 220
MeV). The lines on par* and dens* files correspond to each other,
i.e. the nth line in *par*.dat gives a temperature and the nth
line in *dens*.dat gives the corresponding densities and
pressure. Note that the densities and temperature in the files run
from the highest value _down_.

The file

        pdg05.dat

contains the hadrons and resonances included in the hadron resonance
gas. The format is explained at the end of the file.

When constructing the EoS below chemical freeze-out temperature, we
follow the procedure explained in Bebie et al. Nucl. Phys. B, 378, 95
(1992) (see also Hirano and Tsuda, Phys. Rev. C 66, 054905 (2002)). We
assume that the particle number changing processes cease below T = 165
MeV temperature, but that the resonance formation and decay processes
continue as in higher temperatures. This means that there is no
separate chemical potential associated with each particle/resonance
species, but only with those species considered stable. The chemical
potential for a resonance i is obtained from mu_i = sum_j mu_j n^i_j
where mu_j is the chemical potential associated with a particle j and
the n^i_j is the average number of particles j formed in a decay of
particle i.

We have considered stable all the particles/resonances with lifetime
longer than 40 fm/c, and consider each isospin state individually. 
This list of particles can either be reconstructed from the list
pdg05.dat, or seen in the file particles.dat. In that file the names
of all the particles in pdg05.dat and their lifetimes are listed. The
particles considered stable are also numbered in the very first
column. The numbers of daughter particles are not separately listed,
but can be constructed from the information in the pdg05.dat file.

The files 

        s95p-PCE165-v0_pidens1.dat
	s95p-PCE165-v0_pichem1.dat

contain the particle-number densities and chemical potentials required
for the chemically non-equilibrated description. These files begin
with the same two lines than *dens*.dat and *par*.dat files,

    e0
    de	ne

and the meaning of these numbers is also the same than in *dens*.dat
and *par*.dat files. The third line contains a single number, 'nn',
which is the number of stable particles and thus the number of
separate chemical potentials below the chemical freeze-out
temperature.

From the fourth line on the files contain a two dimensional table with
'nn' columns and 'ne' rows. The j:th column corresponds to the j:th
stable particle in pdg05.dat, or to the number in the first column in
particles.dat. The i:th row corresponds (again) to the i:th row in
*par1.dat and *dens1.dat files, i.e. to temperature/energy density.

The file *pichem1.dat contains chemical potentials (in GeV)
and the file *pidens1.dat contains effective densities of
the stable particles (in fm^-3). "Effective" means that the, say,
first column does not contain the actual density of positive pions,
but what the density of positive pions would be if all the resonances
decayed releasing their daughter particles. The latter is not needed
for hydrodynamical evolution, but can be used as a consistency check
when calculating the spectra.
