This file contains instructions for files

	pdg.dat
	hidut.dat

pdg.dat contains the list of particles included in the hadron gas,
their properties and decay channels. The format is similar to the
AZHYDRO file resoweak.dat, BUT it is not identical. The first column
contains the Monte-Carlo id-number of the particle, and it is wider in
pdg.dat than in resoweak.dat to accommodate the present longer
Monte-Carlo numbers. azspectra0p2.f should be able to handle the file
in this format without changes, but the particle decay routine reso
must be modifield to allow larger mc-numbers. This can be done by
changing the constant MAXINTV in the file reso.h to 20000000.

The pdg.dat file includes all strange and nonstrange particles in the
2005 Particle Data Book up to 2 GeV mass, with the exception of
f_0(600) which was excluded, and f2(2010) and Omega(2250) which were
included even if they are heavier than 2 GeV.

The file hidut.dat contains just the names of the particles, their
lifetimes and whether they are considered stable during the chemically
frozen stage. The numbers in the first column correspond to the
columns in the pidens.dat and pichem.dat files - the particle labeled
1 has its potential listed in the first column, 2 in the second etc.
