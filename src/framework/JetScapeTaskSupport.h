/** TaskSupport instance class (meant as singelton)
 * Keeps track of every created task in a thread-safe manner
 * and provides resources that depend on such information
 * Initial reason was to provide tasks with random seeds
 * such that reproducible running is possible
 * It provides a random engine factory.
 * That way individual random engines can be used where necessary
 * but by default all can use the same 
 * (the state of mersenne twister can be  rather large)
 * 
 * Note that (apart from Microsoft VS2013), magic statics should ensure that
 * the Instance() method is automagically thread safe 
 * 
 * Note 2: make_unique doesn't work for some reason. "new" does the trick here though.
