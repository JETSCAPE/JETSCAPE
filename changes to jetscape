Changes made to JetScape:

-JETSCAPE/

--external_packages/

---LBTD/
   Add external package LBT Duke version (LBTD). Modify some CmakeLists.txt accordingly.

--examples/

---LBTD_brickTest.cc
   Add brick test for LBTD which use pgun as initialization and can sweep over input parameters like temperature and initial energy. 

---fjcorereaderTest.cc
   Add fjcorereaderTest which only analyze final parton jets and deal with heavy quarks especially. 

--src/

---framework/

----JetScapeParticles.h(.cc)
    Make the JetScapeParticleBase inherit from fjcore::PseudoJet::UserInfoBase as well so we can later inquire details of the final parton in FastJet.
    Add new attribute absorp_time for heavy quark evolution. 
    Add new attribute hq_channel and hq_mother_id for heavy quark so we know how the heavy quarks were produced in Pythia throughout JetScape simulation. 
    
----JetScapeWriterStream.h
    Let the writer print hq_channel and hq_mother_id information for heavy quarks at the beginning of parton showering (in comment form so it does not affect other people's analysis).

----PartonShower.cc
    Set a pointer to the final parton so we can access it in FastJet.

----StringTokenizer.h(.cc)
    Add one function to determine if one line contains information for heavy quark.

---hydro/

----GubserHydro.cc
    Sometimes the velocity of the fluid cell exceeds light speed (probably due to some rounding error). Add an additional normalization for velocity of the fluid cell.

---initialstate/

----PGun.h(.cc)
    Add new attribute parId so we can produce udscb quarks. Also changed fixed_pT to fixed_E0 (just for the convenience of my own study). 

----PythiaGun.cc
    For heavy quarks, record their production type (1: flavor creation, 2: flavor excitation, 3: gluon splitting) and mother_id in the parton class in JetScape.

---jet/

----LBTD.h(.cc)
    Basically a wrapper for the LBTD energy loss module. 

---reader/

----JetScapeReader.h(.cc)
    The reader can now read in information for the heavy quarks in the comment of the output file.

In conclusion:
    1. LBTD module added.
    2. Some modification to Pythia, JetScape parton class, JetScape writter and reader class so we can record the production channel and mother_id for heavy quarks.
    3. Analysis for heavy quark jets and dijets with different production channel is now possible. 

I was wondering should we also do these modifications for the heavy hadrons so it also contains additional information for the heavy quark it contains.
